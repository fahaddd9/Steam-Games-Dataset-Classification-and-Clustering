    <p class="lead">
        This section compares the performance of <strong>KNN</strong>, <strong>Naïve Bayes</strong>, <strong>Random Forest</strong>, and <strong>K-Means</strong> to determine the best approach for classifying and clustering Steam games. After thorough evaluation, I selected <strong>Random Forest</strong> as the top performer for classification due to its superior accuracy and ability to handle imbalanced data.
