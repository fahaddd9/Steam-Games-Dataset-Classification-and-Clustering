        Dive into an exciting exploration of Steam games through the lens of artificial intelligence! This project leverages machine learning to <strong>classify</strong> games into genres and <strong>cluster</strong> them based on shared characteristics. After preprocessing a dataset of <em>26,145 games</em>, I focused on the top four genres: <strong>Action</strong>, <strong>Adventure</strong>, <strong>RPG</strong>, and <strong>Simulation</strong>.
    </p>

        Using <strong>KNN</strong>, <strong>Na√Øve Bayes</strong>, and <strong>Random Forest</strong>, I built models to predict game genres, while <strong>K-Means</strong> clustering revealed hidden patterns in the data. Navigate through the tabs above to explore the dataset, view detailed results, analyze visualizations, and discover how I enhanced the models for better performance.
